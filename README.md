ðŸ“Š R Learning Journey â€“ Business Analytics Focus

This repository documents my daily progress in learning R programming for Business Analytics.
Each day includes practice scripts (dayX_Rpractice.R) and reflections on how the concepts connect to real-world business analytics.

ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ R Basics & Importing Data
ðŸ”¹ Concepts Learned

Setting up R and RStudio.

Variables, vectors, and data frames.

Importing a CSV file into R.

Exploring datasets with head(), str(), and summary().

ðŸ”¹ Business Interpretation

Data frames in R = business datasets (e.g., customer info, sales records).

Importing data = pulling raw business data into an analytics system.

Basic summaries = quick insights for managers before deep analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Files Added

day1_Rpractice.R â€“ R basics and CSV import code.

students.csv â€“ Sample dataset used for practice.

ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ One-Variable Charts & Data Modification
ðŸ”¹ Concepts Learned

Histograms â†’ Understanding the distribution of a numeric variable (mpg).

Bar Charts â†’ Visualizing categorical data (cyl â€“ number of cylinders).

Summary Statistics â†’ Mean, median, min, max for hp (horsepower).

Data Modification â†’

Created a new column efficiency = mpg / cyl.

Filtered cars with mpg > 25.

Selected only important variables (mpg, hp, cyl).

ðŸ”¹ Business Interpretation

Histogram of mpg â†’ Similar to analyzing product efficiency across a portfolio.

Bar chart of cyl â†’ Like studying product categories (basic, mid-range, premium).

Summary stats for hp â†’ Useful to benchmark performance (e.g., comparing horsepower = product strength).

Filtering & new KPI â†’ Shows how analysts create new business metrics and focus only on high performers.

ðŸ”¹ Files Added

day2_Rpractice.R â€“ Contains code for todayâ€™s practice.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps (Day 3): Scatterplots and associations between variables (e.g., how horsepower relates to efficiency).
