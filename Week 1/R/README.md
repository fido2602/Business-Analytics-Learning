 R Folder â€“ Week 1

This folder contains all R scripts and practice for Week 1 of the Business Analytics Learning journey.

ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ R Basics & Importing Data

**Concepts Learned:**
- Setting up R and RStudio
- Variables, vectors, and data frames
- Importing CSV files
- Exploring datasets with `head()`, `str()`, and `summary()`

**Business Interpretation:**
- Data frames = business datasets (e.g., customer info, sales records)
- Importing data = pulling raw business data into analytics system
- Basic summaries = quick insights before deeper analysis

**Files Added:**
- `day1_Rpractice.R` â€“ R basics and CSV import code
- `students.csv` â€“ Sample dataset used for practice

 ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ One-Variable Charts & Data Modification

**Concepts Learned:**
- Histograms â†’ distribution of a numeric variable (`mpg`)
- Bar charts â†’ visualizing categorical data (`cyl`)
- Summary statistics â†’ mean, median, min, max for `hp`
- Data modification:
  - Added new column `efficiency = mpg / cyl`
  - Filtered cars with `mpg > 25`
  - Selected important variables only (`mpg`, `hp`, `cyl`)

**Business Interpretation:**
- Histogram â†’ analyze product efficiency across portfolio
- Bar chart â†’ studying product categories
- Summary stats â†’ benchmark performance
- Filtering & KPI â†’ create new business metrics

**Files Added:**
- `day2_Rpractice.R` â€“ Contains code for today's practice

ðŸ“Œ **Next Steps (Day 3):** Scatterplots and associations between variables (e.g., how horsepower relates to efficiency)
