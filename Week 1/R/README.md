Week 1 â€“ R Scripts

This folder contains R practice scripts for Week 1 of my Business Analytics learning journey. Each script demonstrates key R concepts, data handling, and visualization techniques.

ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ R Basics & Importing Data

Concepts Learned:

Setting up R and RStudio

Variables, vectors, and data frames

Importing CSV files into R

Exploring datasets with head(), str(), and summary()

Business Interpretation:

Data frames in R = business datasets (e.g., customer info, sales records)

Importing data = pulling raw business data into an analytics system

Basic summaries = quick insights for managers before deep analysis

Files:

day1_Rpractice.R â€“ R basics and CSV import code

students.csv â€“ Sample dataset used for practice

ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ One-Variable Charts & Data Modification

Concepts Learned:

Histograms â†’ Distribution of numeric variables (mpg)

Bar Charts â†’ Visualizing categorical data (cyl)

Summary statistics â†’ Mean, median, min, max (hp)

Data modification â†’ New columns, filtering, selecting important variables

Business Interpretation:

Histogram of mpg â†’ Analyzing product efficiency across a portfolio

Bar chart of cyl â†’ Studying product categories (basic, mid-range, premium)

Summary stats for hp â†’ Benchmarking performance (e.g., horsepower = product strength)

Filtering & new KPI â†’ Focus on high performers

Files:

day2_Rpractice.R â€“ R practice script with charts and data modifications

This README will live inside Week 1/R/ and provide a clear context for anyone looking at your R scripts.
