Basic summaries = quick insights before deeper analysis

Files Added:

day1_Rpractice.R â€“ R basics and CSV import code

../datasets/students.csv â€“ Sample dataset used for practice

ðŸ“Œ Day 2 â€“ Data Exploration & Transformation

Concepts Learned:

Inspecting data with head(), str(), summary()

Creating new columns using ifelse()

Filtering rows (subset())

Sorting data (order())

Business Interpretation:

Data exploration = understanding raw student performance data

Adding new columns = deriving business KPIs (e.g., Passed/Failed)

Filtering = segmenting customers/students by performance

Sorting = ranking students/customers by score

Files Added:
